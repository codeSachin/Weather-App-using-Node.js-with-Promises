# Weather-App-using-Node.js-with-Promises
Made a weather telling app using Node.js.    Used google's geocode api for fetching latitude and longitude and then fed it to weather api. Just learning node.js :) But this time i used third party library called AXIOS because i wanted to do the same stuff with promises this time. And moreover it reduced the code size too


Just do npm install while cloning this project
